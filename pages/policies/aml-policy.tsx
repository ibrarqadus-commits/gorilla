        <h1>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy Notice</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Streets of London (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to promoting high ethical standards and full compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws in the United Kingdom. Although we do not conduct regulated estate agency transactions or handle client money, we educate and train individuals who intend to operate within the property sector, where such regulations apply.</p>
        <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
        <p>This policy outlines our stance on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and our commitment to ensuring that our training content and business operations align with the principles set out under the following legislation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017</li>
          <li>The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</li>
          <li>The Terrorism Act 2000</li>
          <li>The Criminal Finances Act 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Our Role as a Training Provider</h2>
        <p>As an educational organisation, The Streets of London does not currently act as an estate agency or property intermediary and therefore does not require registration with HMRC for AML supervision. However, we actively promote compliance awareness within our training materials and mentoring sessions to prepare students for industry best practice.</p>
        <h2>4. AML Awareness Training</h2>
        <p>All courses, workshops, and mentorship programmes include education on AML requirements, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer due diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures</li>
          <li>Recognising suspicious transactions</li>
          <li>Reporting obligations and record-keeping</li>
          <li>Penalties for non-compliance</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Commitment to Compliance</h2>
        <p>We maintain internal awareness of changes to AML legislation and ensure our teaching content remains current and compliant with UK regulatory standards. We also encourage our students to register for HMRC AML supervision when establishing their own estate agency businesses.</p>
        <h2>6. Reporting Concerns</h2>
        <p>If we become aware of any suspicious activity in connection with our services, we will take appropriate action consistent with the UK’s AML framework, which may include reporting to the National Crime Agency (NCA).</p>
